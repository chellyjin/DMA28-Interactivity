          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This course has two goals. (1) To provide an introduction to writing code within the context of the visual arts. Writing code involves learning a different way of thinking and making. (2) To interrogate the concept of 'interactivity' and consider how this applies to art, design, and code. Through this exploration you may gain a deeper understanding of how users, viewers, and people experience your work.</p>

          <p>The ideas and skills taught in this course set a foundation for future Design Media Arts courses about the internet (161), game design (157), and media arts (159A, 171).</p>

          <h3>Expectations</h3>
          <span class='label'>Grading.</span> Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
            <ul>
              <li>Project 0 10%</li>
              <li>Project 1 10%</li>
              <li>Project 2 10%</li>
              <li>Project 3 10%</li>
              <li>Project 4 10%</li>
              <li>Project 5 10%</li>
              <li>Final project 30%</li>
              <li>Participation 10%</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs.</p>
          
          <p><span class='label'><a onclick='openSection("#projects")'>Projects.</a></span> Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned via the <a href='https://goo.gl/forms/tHeaanOOIDTr3NOm2'>online form</a>. Projects may be turned in up to one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline.</p>


          <p><span class='label'>Media.</span> Each project will be accompanied by a collection of readings, videos, and other media to look at. You are expected to read/watch/consume each item listed. Doing so will make this class much easier and more enjoyable. If it is clear you are not doing this work, your project grades will lower.</p>

          <p><span class='label'>Participation.</span> Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for meetings, offer feedback during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If there are concerns please let me or Hye Min know as soon as possible.</p>
          
          <p><span class='label'><a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16dWc859RkhebYJE3cqERsGFiyyLLTW0MNH-i4vKQ5Kc/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>Attendance.</a></span>You get one unexcused absence, no questions asked. Each unexcused absence after that will result in one full letter grade deduction. Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in the class. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, email <a href='mailto:hyeminchocho@gmail.com'>Hye Min</a> before class. Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy. Three tardies results in one unexcused absence. Your attendance can be viewed <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16dWc859RkhebYJE3cqERsGFiyyLLTW0MNH-i4vKQ5Kc/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>here</a>, any disputes should be discussed with the TA within two weeks.</p>

          <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h3>
          <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.

          <h3>Disability Services</h3>
          <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It is necessary for you to register with the <a href='http://www.cae.ucla.edu/'>UCLA Center for Accessible Education</a> so that we can establish reasonable accommodations. After registration, make arrangements with me to discuss how to implement these accommodations.</p>

            Think about the three ideas you presented in your pecha kucha. Pick one to move forward with, or pick something else entirely, and begin to flesh it out. What is the subject matter you're dealing with? What are the tools and media you will use to explore it? Your project should build on what is already showing in your porfolio. Recognize your strengths, and use those skills rather than work in a medium that you have no experience with.<br><br>
            Your project brief should give a description of your project, including its aims, its areas of research, its intended audiences, and a realistic production timeline. Come up with a list of questions you have, and that you want to find answers to, during the design process.

            Starting with your project brief, spend this week researching the context and precedents for your topic and ideas. You will focus on research this week, but the research should continue throughout the 10 weeks process.<br><br>
            Content-wise: Who wrote about this? What are the different points of view? What are the pros and cons? Collect texts, articles, images, interviews, links, etc.<br><br>
            Image-wise: What does the subject matter look like? How have other artists visualized the subject matter? What do you want the subject matter to look like? Collect images, photographs, notes.

            In your meeting this week, you will confirm the details of what you will present for the midterm review. The midterm review should be a proof of concept / prototype of your final project. See the info under <a onclick='openSection('#projects', 'p5')'>midterm review</a> for more details.<br><br>
            Please prepare a document that includes:
            <ol>
              <li>Short description of your project, including final output. Three sentences or less.</li>
              <li>Description of what you plan to show for the review. You might include sketches or mockups.</li>
              <li>What are the main questions you hope to answer in the review? Consider: Are there interactions you want to test? Are there specific parts that you want feedback on? You might try writing about what experience you hope the audience has, to compare with how they actually react.</li>
              <li>What work do you need to do in the next week to get there?</li>
            </ol>

          <h3 id='p5'>Project 5: Dynamic (DUE 2/20)</h3>
          <div id='p5-content' class='toggle' style='display:none;'>
            The midterm is a chance to get feedback from a range of people. You should prepare a prototype of your final project that will serve as a proof of concept. This should be something further developed than sketches or an idea proposal. You can use multiple forms to communicate your idea. For example: If you are making an interactive website, you might show a simplified version in progress alongside illustrator mock-ups of how you'd like the pages to look. If you are creating an installation, you might install some of the unfinished elements, and include stand-in objects or drawings for the parts that aren't built yet. You will be installing somewhere on the 4th floor. All three classrooms are open, as are the hallway and common spaces. It's up to you to work out space amongst yourselves.
            <br><br>
            Think of this as a first user test, there should be an experience of a thing (not just a hypothetical idea) for us to react to. The goal is to get feedback on how the work is functioning already, and ideas about where it might go. We will be breaking into smaller groups for the review, mixing classes. Practice explaining your project in a minute or less so you can get the maximum time for feedback. Copies of the project descriptions will be distributed so ideally you won't need to say anything at all. It is recommended that you bring a list of questions you hope to answer and see if you can write out answers to them after the review.
            <br><br>
            <b>IMPORTANT!</b> You must input your project info, description, and equipment requests into the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VpE9JW-4CE_yfZtL2O7kqzb1K3_KSSeLlWtLO1DOqvk/edit#gid=1873695528'>show spreadsheet</a> by the EOD on 4/30. Failure to do so will mean you won't get priority consideration for your equipment requests.
